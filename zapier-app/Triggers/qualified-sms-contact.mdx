## Step 5

When in the **"Configure"** after you've named your integration, you will then select the SMS agent this integration will be for. Click the \*\*"Qualified SMS Contact Example" \*\*dropdown and you should see a list with all of your current active SMS agents.

(Notes: If you do not see any agents or the agent you're looking for, make sure you have SMS agents in your account.)

## Step 6

Once you've named your integration and selected your sms agent click **"Continue"** at the bottom and you should now be in the **"Test"** tab. Click the **"Test Trigger"** button at the bottom. You should get an example payload. This is a full payload example for the selected agent for mapping your data for your next action.

(Note: The example payload is not live data. It serves for mapping your data in Zapier only)

## Step 7

Once you've selected your next Zapier action(s) and have published your zap, your integration should be available for activation in your Teli account for your SMS campaigns. SMS contacts can be pushed to your Zapier integration automatically or manually.

Access one of your SMS campaigns and click on any lead. You should see a **"Lead Details" **section to the right. In that section, you should see 3 vertically stacked dots. Click on that and a menu should appear. Next, click the **"CRM Setup"**.  A popup should appear titled **"Integration Setup"**. 

(Note: Pushing leads manually is always an option no matter how you setup your integration.)
