## Step 4

Click on the **"Configure"** tab where you will name your integration.

(Note: The integration name does not prevent duplicate names.)

## Step 5

When in the **"Configure"** after you've named your integration, you will then select the voice agent this integration will be for. Click the **"Completed Call Data Example"** dropdown and you should see a list with all of your current active voice agents.

(Notes: If you do not see any agents or the agent you're looking for, be sure to double check your Teli account that your agents are deployed and the status says **"Active"**)

## Step 6

Once you've named your integration and selected your voice agent click **"Continue"** at the bottom and you should now be in the **"Test"** tab. Click the **"Test Trigger"** button at the bottom. You should get an example payload. This is a full payload example for the selected agent for mapping your data for your next action.

(Note: The example payload is not live data. It serves for mapping your data in Zapier only)

## Step 7

Once you've selected your next Zapier action(s) and have published your zap, your integration should be available for activation in your Teli account for inbound, outbound and manual pushes.

### Manual Push

You can locate the manual push set up in the\*\*"Call History"\*\*  tab. There should be a menu button in the top right corner of the\*\*"Anlytics"\*\*  section. Click the 3 dots and menu should appear. Click **"Connect CRM"**. A popup should appear with a dropdown of your integration options.

Once activated, whenever you wish to push call data to your Zapier integration, click the same 3 dot menu button again and click the\*\*"Push to CRM"\*\*  button.
