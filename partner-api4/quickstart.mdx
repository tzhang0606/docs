  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_type": "voice",
    "agent_name": "Voice Sales Agent",
    "starting_message": "Hi {'{'}{'{'}}first_name{'}'}{'}'},how can I help you today?",
    "prompt": "You are a helpful voice assistant. Ask about their needs.",
    "voice_id": "11labs-Adrian",
    "language": "en-US",
    "organization_id": "{org_id}",
    "user_id": "{user_id}"
  }'
```

Save the `voice_agent_id` from the response.

curl -X POST https://api.teli.ai/v1/voice/phone-numbers/create \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \

  -d '{
    "area_code": "415",
    "user_id": "{user_id}",
    "organization_id": "{org_id}",
    "tenant_id": "{tenant_id}"
  }'
```

Save the `phone_number` from the response (e.g., "+14155551234").

## Step 5: Upload Contacts

Same as SMS Quick Start Step 4 above.

## Step 6: Create Voice Campaign

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.teli.ai/v1/voice/campaigns \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "leads": [
      {"phone_number": "+15551234567", "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe"}
    ],
    "voice_agent_id": "{voice_agent_id}",
    "agent_outbound_number": "{provisioned_phone}",
    "organization_id": "{org_id}",
    "tenant_id": "{tenant_id}"
  }'
```

# SMS-to-Voice Transfer

Enable seamless escalation from SMS to voice calls.

## Setup

1. **Create both agents** (SMS + Voice) as shown above
2. **Provision phone number** for voice calls
3. **Create SMS campaign with voice transfer enabled**:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.teli.ai/v1/campaigns \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "campaign_name": "SMS with Voice Transfer",
    "sms_agent_id": "{sms_agent_id}",
    "teli_sms_number": "+15551000001",
    "enable_sms_to_voice": true,
    "voice_agent_id": "{voice_agent_id}",
    "outbound_number": "{provisioned_phone}",
    "organization_id": "{org_id}",
    "user_id": "{user_id}",
    "contacts": [{"phone_number": "+15551234567", "first_name": "John"}]
  }'
```

**How It Works:**
- Conversation starts via SMS
- AI can trigger phone call if user requests
- Seamless transition to voice
- Same conversation context maintained
