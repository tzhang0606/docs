## Campaign Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `active` | Campaign is currently making calls |
| `paused` | Campaign is temporarily paused |
| `completed` | All contacts have been called |
| `ended` | Campaign has been manually ended |

## Notes

- Voice campaigns make automated calls to contact lists
- Uses Teli Voice agents for AI-powered conversations
- Supports pause/resume/end operations
- Admin users see all org campaigns, regular users see filtered view
- Campaigns are scoped by tenant_id for multi-tenant isolation
