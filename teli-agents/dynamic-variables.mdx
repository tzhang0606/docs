    description="Dynamic Variables allow you to insert real-time data into your messages, providing a way to personalize and automate campaigns. This helps to engage with your audience in a more meaningful way by using their specific data."
  >
    **Personalized Messaging:** Add placeholders like `{customer_name}` to automatically populate messages with user-specific data.

    **Real-time Updates:** Information like `{first_name}` or `{location}` are replaced when the campaign is triggered, ensuring up-to-date communication.

    **Data-Driven Automation:** Simplify your processes by allowing dynamic content to adapt automatically based on user data.

    title="How to Use Dynamic Variables"
    icon="solid edit"
    description="To implement dynamic variables, include placeholders within your campaign's messages. When the campaign is triggered, these placeholders are replaced with the userâ€™s actual data."
  >
    **Step 1:** In the message body, use placeholders like `{first_name}`, `{company_name}`, or `{phone_number}`.

    **Step 2:** Ensure the placeholders align with available user data, such as CRM fields.

    **Step 3:** During execution, Teli AI replaces these placeholders with the real values from your database.

    **Fallback Values:** Use fallback values (e.g., `{first_name | 'there'}`) to ensure your message remains meaningful even when data is missing.

    **Clear Placeholders:** Make sure placeholders are descriptive and simple to avoid confusion (e.g., `{customer_name}` instead of `{user_info}`).

    **Test Thoroughly:** Run test campaigns with sample data to ensure the variables are correctly replaced before launching live campaigns.
