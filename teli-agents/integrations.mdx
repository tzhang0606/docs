## Integrating Teli AI with Other Platforms

Teli AI offers seamless integration capabilities that allow you to connect with various third-party platforms, expanding the scope and functionality of your AI-powered campaigns.

## Native Plugins

Native plugins are integrations that Teli supports natively. Once activated, you can directly connect these plugins into your agent setup.

### **1. Cal.com**

By entering Cal.com API key into Teli, our AI Agents will be able to check your linked calendars in real time. Enabling this plugin will allow you to specify an appointment booking script, and allow voice agents to check calendar and book appointments during live conversation.

### **2. Email Alerts**

By entering your email address, or enabling email alerts for your organization for an additional usage-based fee, you or your entire organization will receive an email after every phone call with detailed information.

### **3. ElevenLabs**

By enabling ElevenLabs, you will have access to the voice library. This allows you to choose from a variety of voices that you can select to further customize your AI agents. If you would like to train an agent with your own voice or have your own voice model, please contact us for a training session.

### **4. Zapier**

Teli also supports custom hooks and triggers for Zapier. Please reach out to us for a consultation on how best to set up Zapier connections.

## Teli Automations

Beyond Native Plugins, Teli also has the ability for you to build robust workflows with hundreds of other softwares. Our team provides various tiers of support depending on your technical experience with API based workflows:

- Tier 1: Your premium plan includes free activation of custom workflows. This tier allows you to customize your workflows by yourself, with Teli's team providing basic support when necessary.
- Tier 2: For a one-time onboarding fee, Teli's team will engineer a dedicated flow for your specific integration use case. We handle the build, the testing, as well as maintainence.
- Tier 3: For more significant integrations that would require substantial changes to Teli's core offering, we work with enterprise customers directly to implement custom API integrations.
