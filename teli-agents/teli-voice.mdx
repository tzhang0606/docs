# Teli Voice: Powering Your Voice Campaigns

Teli AI enables you to create and manage voice campaigns, allowing you to automate calls, collect data, and engage with your customers more effectively. With Teli Voice, you can enhance your customer interactions and improve your campaign outcomes.

## Campaign types

Teli Voice offers three different campaign types to support differnt use cases

- **Inbound**: AI agents accepting inbound calls 24/7. Best for customer service and receptionists.
- **Bulk Outbound**: AI agents that reach over thousands of contacts within minutes. Best for call centers, lead qualification, and sales.
- **Gradual Live Transfer**: AI agents that call a set number of contacts at once, transferring warm conversations to a human agent. Best for AI collaboration with human teams in mortgage, insurance, and other human-in-the-loop use cases.

## Handling Inbound Calls

### 1. **Set up and deploy an inbound agent**

Create an inbound agent from a template or customize your own. Feel free to add any dynamic variables if you have a contact group for the inbound agent to reference when accepting calls.

### 2. **Create a campaign**

Navigate to Teli Voice and create a new campaign. After naming your campaign, please select the inbound campaign type.

### 3. **Purchase a phone number**

To set up an inbound campaign, you need to purchase a unique Teli phone number. Different campaigns may not use the same phone number. On the campaign set up window, select a phone number that is not currently in use and activate it.

### 4. **Assign a custom agent**

On the campaign set up window, select the agent that you created in step one and activate it. Congrats, now your number is all set to accept inbound calls!

### **5. Referencing additional data (optional)**

If you would like your inbound agent to know who is calling, you must supply a contact group for reference. Teli AI automatically matches the inbound phone calls with the contacts' phone number from your reference contact group, and it extacts corresponding information to use during live conversation. This allows your agent to engage in a more personalized conversation.

Note that when a human team member accepts a call, that member will be marked unavailable until he confirms that the call is over on his Teli account. When all human members are busy, Teli dialer will pause automatically before starting the next batch of calls.
