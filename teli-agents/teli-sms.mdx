# Teli SMS: AI Agents Automating Texting

Teli AI's agents will completely take over thousands of SMS threads, only forwarding it to the human team when an objective has been reached. Teli will also follow up indefintely until an objective has been reached. Set up once, and never worry about SMS again.

## Organization verification

To enable SMS campaigns, your organization must be verified due to legal requirements in the US. You can do so by booking an appoinment with our team at any time. We will get back to you with document requests as soon as we can. It tyically takes a few days to a week for your organization to be approved. At this time, we will also secure qualified and dedicated phone numbers for your SMS campaigns. All compliance measures such as DO NOT TEXT are implemented automatically.

## Setting up SMS campaigns

### 1\. **Set up and deploy SMS agent**

Create a SMS agent from a template or customize your own. Feel free to add any dynamic variables if you have a contact group for the inbound agent to reference when accepting calls.

### 2\. **Create a campaign**

Navigate to Teli SMS and create a new campaign. After naming your campaign, please select the contact group you would like to send texts to.

### **3\. Monitor texts**

**Teli will automatically send, respond, and follow up with your SMS threads until your objective has been met.**

- Texts with a blue dot represent threads that Teli's AI agent is actively engaging in.
- Texts with a green dot represent threads that have a completed objective.
- Texts with a red dot and title represent threads with opted-out contacts. Teli's AI agents will not continue to engage with these threads or contacts via SMS or phone call in the future until they are manually whitelisted.
