## What are Agents?

Teli's agents are artificial intelligent employees that can call and text. Teli allows you to create and manage these AI agents to handle customer interactions more efficiently. Agents can be customized with different workflows, responses, and integrations to suit your business needs.

## Why Use Agents?

Agents in Teli AI provide several benefits:

- **Automated Responses** – Reduce response time by setting up AI-powered automation.
- **Personalized Interactions** – Customize responses based on customer data and history.
- **Scalability** – Easily manage multiple agents to handle large volumes of interactions.

## Creating an Agent

Follow these steps to create an agent in Teli AI:

1. **Navigate to the Agents Dashboard** – Access the agents section from your Teli AI account.
2. **Click on ‘Create Agent’** – Enter the details, including name, role, and primary function.
3. **Select a Template** – You can choose from templates that fit your business needs, or select "Custom" to create a custom agent.
4. **Cstuomize Agent** – Templated agents come with default parameters, such as the general prompt, voice, emotions, and more. You can change each parameter to suit your needs. By integrating native plugins, you can also give the agent abilities such as booking appointment live during call, using your cloned voice, etc.
5. **Deploy and Monitor** – Activate your agent and track performance through analytics.

## Agent Types

### 1\. **Voice Agents**

Unless specifically indicated, all templated agents are voice agents. These agents will primarily interact with customers via real-time phone calls.

### 2\. **SMS Agents**

When creating an agent, selecting "SMS" will create a custom SMS agent. These agents will handle two-way texting automatically until the conversation reaches your predefined objective (e.g. ready to book a call, ready to purchase, or confirm an intent).
