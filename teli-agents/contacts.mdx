## Managing Contacts in Teli AI

Teli AI provides a simple yet powerful way to manage your contacts and personalize communication. By organizing and segmenting your contacts, you can ensure more targeted and efficient interactions.

## Contact Groups

When running a campaign, you will almost always engage with contact groups. Contact groups are a collection of contacts that you will want Teli's AI Agents to call. Teli will accept CSV files and automatically create mapping suggestions to parse your data. You can map fields such as first name, last name, birthday, and more fields (see section of dynamic variables for the full list).

## Using Contact Group

### **1\. Outbound Campaigns**

When you upload contacts to Teli, it is synchronized across all devices with permission to access. When you inititate an outbound campaign (call or SMS), you must select a contact group. In the next section, we will provide additional details on campaign behavior.

### **2\. Inbound Campaigns**

Contact group can be linked to inbound campaigns for referencing. When a customer from your contact list calls your inbound number, the associated agent will now have knowledge about that customer. This makes the conversation more natural and personalized.

## Contact Features

### **1\. Auto-Compliance**

During a call or message thread, Teli AI's safety system will automatically detect if a contact does not want to be contacted. The system will flag the contact across all contact groups and display it with a red label followed by "DO NOT CALL". This ensures that your campaigns are always compliant with official regulations.

### **2\. Data Security**

You can store sensitive variables such as users' medical information and social security numbers within contact records. Teli uses robust cryptographic methods to hash and protect these data, both during transit and at rest. Teli's providers conducts frequent penetration testing to ensure compliance at an enterprise level.

### **3\. Integration Friendly**

Contacts are always linked to call history records. As an administrator, you may want to send certain contacts to your employees to follow up. You can do this directly from call history or by connecting thrid party integrations with robust workflows (more on this in the integrations section).
