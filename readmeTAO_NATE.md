We need to add a logo in the header text in place of "Mint Starter Kit". See below.

"$schema": "https://mintlify.com/schema.json",
"name": "Teli AI",
"\_comment": "Add logo here for TELI AI below",
"logo": {
"dark": "/logo/dark.svg",
"light": "/logo/light.svg"
},

I played around with the home/introduction page a bit. This is easily editable.
