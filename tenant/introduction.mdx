  <Accordion title="Users">
    Users belong to organizations and can:
    - Create campaigns, agents, and contact lists
    - Have different permission levels (admin vs regular)
    - Track individual usage metrics
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="SMS Agents">
    Reusable AI conversation templates that can be used across multiple campaigns:
    - **SMS Agents**: Text conversations with custom prompts and drip schedules
    - **Voice Agents**: Phone call capabilities (coming soon)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Campaigns">
    SMS outreach campaigns that:
    - Use an SMS agent for conversations
