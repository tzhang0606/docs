# SMS Phone Numbers

<Note>
**Multi-SMS Feature**: This section is only applicable for tenants that have multiple SMS numbers per organization enabled. The standard configuration is one SMS number per organization. Contact support if you need multi-SMS capabilities.
</Note>

The SMS Phone Numbers API allows organizations to manage multiple SMS numbers with user-level assignment. Each user can have their own dedicated SMS number for campaigns.

## Feature Overview

<Info>
This feature must be enabled for your tenant. Contact support to enable multi-SMS numbers for your organization.
</Info>

### How It Works

1. **Organization purchases SMS numbers** - Numbers are purchased under the org's 10DLC campaign
2. **Admin assigns to users** - Each number can be assigned to a specific user
3. **User creates campaigns** - Campaigns automatically use the user's assigned number
4. **Inbound messages route correctly** - Replies go to the correct user's campaigns

### Key Benefits

- **User Isolation** - Each user has their own dedicated SMS number
- **Clear Attribution** - Know which user sent which messages
- **Scalability** - Add as many numbers as needed (within limits)
- **Billing Transparency** - Track costs per number

## Prerequisites

Before using multi-SMS numbers:

1. Organization must have **10DLC approved** (SMS active)
2. Tenant must have **`enable_multi_sms_numbers`** enabled
3. Organization must be within their **number limit**
