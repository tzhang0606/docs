## Request Body

<ParamField body="disable_ai_response" type="boolean" required>
  Set to `true` to disable AI responses, `false` to re-enable them
</ParamField>

## Response

## Example Request

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL (disable AI)
curl -X POST "https://partner.teli.ai/api/proxy/v1/campaigns/camp_abc123/toggle-ai" \

```

```bash cURL (re-enable AI)
curl -X POST "https://partner.teli.ai/api/proxy/v1/campaigns/camp_abc123/toggle-ai" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"disable_ai_response": false}'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch(
  'https://partner.teli.ai/api/proxy/v1/campaigns/camp_abc123/toggle-ai',
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ disable_ai_response: true })
  }
);
const data = await response.json();
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://partner.teli.ai/api/proxy/v1/campaigns/camp_abc123/toggle-ai',
    headers={'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'},
    json={'disable_ai_response': True}
)
data = response.json()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Example Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "AI responses disabled for campaign camp_abc123",
  "campaign_id": "camp_abc123",
  "disable_ai_response": true,
  "powered_by": "Teli"
}
```

## Behavior When AI is Disabled

- The **starting message** is still sent to each contact when the campaign launches
- When a contact **replies**, the AI does **not** generate a response
- The reply is still **saved** to conversation history and visible in the dashboard
- The contact is marked as **responded** (drip messages stop)
- A human can send manual replies via the [Send SMS](/partner-api/messages/send-sms) or [Bulk Send SMS](/partner-api/messages/bulk-send-sms) endpoints

## Re-enabling AI

You can re-enable AI at any time by setting `disable_ai_response` to `false`. However, note that contacts who **already replied while AI was off** will not receive AI responses even after re-enabling. Those threads were marked as `human_takeover` when the reply came in, so they are considered completed.

Re-enabling AI only affects **contacts who have not yet replied**. Their future inbound messages will be handled by the AI as normal.

If you need to restart AI on a specific thread that was already marked as completed, you would need to create a new campaign with those contacts.

## Campaign Creation

You can also set `disable_ai_response` when creating a campaign:

```json
{
  "campaign_id": "camp_abc123",
  "sms_agent_id": "agent_xyz",
  "disable_ai_response": true,
  ...
}
```
