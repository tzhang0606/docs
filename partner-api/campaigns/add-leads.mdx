## Example Response

{

  "message": "15 leads added successfully",
  "campaign_id": "1770754445650x132473371211333630",
  "details": {

  },

}
```

## Behavior

- **Duplicate detection**: If a phone number already exists in the campaign, it is silently skipped (not an error).
- **Phone normalization**: Phone numbers are automatically normalized to E.164 format.
- **Immediate processing**: New leads are added to the active campaign and will receive the starting message according to the campaign's schedule.
- **Drip scheduling**: If the campaign has drip messaging enabled, drip sequences are automatically scheduled for the new leads.
- **All lead fields supported**: Any field from the contact object (address, company, custom fields) is stored and available for message variable substitution.

## Notes

- The campaign must exist and not be deleted
- Leads with missing `phone_number` are silently skipped
- There is no limit on how many times you can add leads to a campaign
- Variable substitution works with all lead fields: `{{first_name}}`, `{{company_name}}`, `{{city}}`, etc.
