## Campaign Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ACTIVE` | Campaign is currently running and sending messages |
| `PAUSED` | Campaign is temporarily paused |
| `COMPLETED` | All contacts have been messaged |
| `ENDED` | Campaign has been manually ended |

## SMS-to-Voice Transfer

Campaigns can escalate from SMS to voice calls when `enable_sms_to_voice: true`:

**SMS-Only Campaigns:**
```json
{
  "enable_sms_to_voice": false,
  "voice_agent_id": null,
  "voice_agent_id": null,
  "outbound_number": null
}
```

**SMS + Voice Transfer Campaigns:**
```json
{
  "enable_sms_to_voice": true,
  "voice_agent_id": "agent_86f826bf8f59bacd5c10ae948a",
  "voice_agent_id": "agent_86f826bf8f59bacd5c10ae948a",
  "outbound_number": "+15174686941"
}
```

When enabled:
- AI can trigger phone calls during SMS conversations
- Uses specified voice agent and outbound number
- Seamless transition from text to voice

## Variable Substitution

All message templates support dynamic variables:
- `{{first_name}}` - Contact's first name
- `{'{'}{'{'}}last_name{'}'}{'}'}}` - Contact's last name
- `{'{'}{'{'}}email{'}'}{'}'}}` - Contact's email
- Custom fields from lead data

## Notes

- SMS campaigns use agents for AI-powered conversations
- Drip schedules enable automated follow-up sequences
- SMS-to-voice transfer allows escalation to phone calls
- Emoji support in messages (as shown in "emoji test" campaign)
- Admin users see all org campaigns, regular users see only their own
- Phone numbers may appear with or without + prefix in `teli_sms_number`
