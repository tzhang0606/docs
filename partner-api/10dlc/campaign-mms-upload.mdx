# Upload Campaign MMS

Upload an MMS media file (logo, image, etc.) for a 10DLC campaign. The returned `uuid` should be included as `mms_media_uuid` when creating the campaign.

## Two-Step Flow

1. **Upload MMS** — `POST /v1/10dlc/campaign/{campaign_id}/mms` → returns a media `uuid`
2. **Create Campaign** — include `mms_media_uuid: [uuid]` in the [Create Campaign](/partner-api/10dlc/campaign-create) request

## Endpoint

```
POST /v1/10dlc/campaign/{campaign_id}/mms
```

## Authentication

<ParamField header="X-API-Key" type="string" required>
  Your API key
</ParamField>

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="campaign_id" type="string" required>
  The campaign ID to upload MMS for
</ParamField>

## Request Body

Content-Type: `multipart/form-data`

<ParamField body="file" type="file" required>
  The image file to upload (JPEG, PNG, GIF). Max size varies by carrier.
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="uuid" type="string">
  The media UUID to use in campaign creation (`mms_media_uuid`)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="fileName" type="string">
  Original file name
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="mimeType" type="string">
  File MIME type (e.g., `image/jpeg`)
</ResponseField>

## Example Request

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.teli.ai/v1/10dlc/campaign/CEFIHJ5/mms" \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "file=@logo.jpeg"
```

```python Python
import requests

with open('logo.jpeg', 'rb') as f:
    response = requests.post(
        'https://api.teli.ai/v1/10dlc/campaign/CEFIHJ5/mms',
        headers={'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'},
        files={'file': ('logo.jpeg', f, 'image/jpeg')}
    )
data = response.json()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Example Response

```json 200
{
  "uuid": "UPLOAD/SOLDVCR/074851B595FA40EABEE0248B82A2CA5D",
  "fileName": "logo.jpeg",
  "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
  "powered_by": "Teli"
}
```

## Using the UUID in Campaign Creation

After uploading, include the returned `uuid` in your campaign create request:

```json
{
  "brand_id": "B4KRR4F",
  "usecase": "MARKETING",
  "description": "...",
  "mms_media_uuid": ["UPLOAD/SOLDVCR/074851B595FA40EABEE0248B82A2CA5D"],
  "sample1": "...",
  ...
}
```

Multiple MMS files can be uploaded and included as an array.
