title: 'Get Call Extractions'
api: 'GET /v1/voice/calls/{call_id}/extractions'
description: 'Retrieve extracted data from voice call conversations'

## Overview

Retrieve all data extracted from a voice call, including:
- **Extracted fields** - Custom data points extracted from the conversation
- **Extraction config** - What fields were configured for extraction
- **Lead outcome** - Classification result (qualified, dnc, pending, etc.)
- **Objective status** - Whether call objective was met

Extraction happens automatically after each call when `extraction_fields` is configured on the agent.

<Info>
All extracted data is automatically white-labeled (technology provider names removed).

## Best Practices

<Check>
  **Keep fields simple** - Use clear, descriptive field names (e.g., `email`, `phone_number`, `budget`)
</Check>

<Check>
  **Limit field count** - Extract 5-10 fields max per call for best results
</Check>

<Check>
  **Configure on agent** - Set extraction_fields when creating agent for automatic extraction
</Check>

<Check>
  **Poll for results** - Use Get Call Details endpoint to check when extraction is complete
</Check>

---

## Notes

<Warning>
- Extraction happens automatically **after call ends** (not during call)
- Results available within 5-10 seconds of call completion
- Empty `extracted_fields` means either:
  - No extraction_fields configured on agent
  - Call ended before information could be gathered
  - Transcript didn't contain requested information
- All field keys and values are automatically white-labeled
</Warning>
