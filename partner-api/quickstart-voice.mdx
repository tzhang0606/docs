## Overview

This guide will walk you through creating your first voice campaign with AI-powered phone conversations.

## Prerequisites

- API key (contact your account manager)
- Basic knowledge of REST APIs
- cURL, JavaScript, or Python
- Organization and User already created (see SMS Quick Start)

---

## Step 1: Create Voice Agent

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.teli.ai/v1/agents \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_type": "voice",
    "agent_name": "Voice Sales Agent",
    "starting_message": "Hi {'{'}{'{'}}first_name{'}'}{'}'},how can I help you today?",
    "prompt": "You are a professional voice assistant. Ask about their needs and offer solutions.",
    "voice_id": "11labs-Adrian",
    "language": "en-US",
    "organization_id": "{org_id}",
    "user_id": "{user_id}"
  }'
```

<Tip>
Choose from voices like "11labs-Adrian", "11labs-Josh", "11labs-Emily" for different tones!
</Tip>

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "agent_id": "1763487456442x530311914019296484",
  "agent_type": "voice",
  "voice_agent_id": "agent_76e782f267fad7f112b2339e2f",
  "voice_llm_id": "llm_76ba232bb992d5bc1ca3b83b6a00",
  "agent_name": "Voice Sales Agent",
  "powered_by": "Teli"
}
```

<Note>
Save the `voice_agent_id` - you'll need it to create campaigns!
</Note>

## Step 2: Provision Phone Number

Voice campaigns require an outbound phone number.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.teli.ai/v1/voice/phone-numbers/create \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "area_code": "415",
    "user_id": "{user_id}",
    "organization_id": "{org_id}",
    "tenant_id": "{tenant_id}"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "phone_number": "+14155551234",
  "phone_number_pretty": "+1 415-555-1234",
  "area_code": "415",
  "phone_number_type": "teli-voice-twilio",
  "powered_by": "Teli"
}
```

<Tip>
Phone numbers are instant - no approval needed! Choose any US/Canada area code.
</Tip>

  -d '{
    "list_name": "Voice Leads",
    "organization_id": "{org_id}",
    "user_id": "{user_id}",
    "contacts": [
      {
        "phone_number": "+15177304034",
        "first_name": "Pranta",
        "last_name": "Barua",
        "email": "pranta@example.com"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

## Step 4: Create Voice Campaign

curl -X POST https://api.teli.ai/v1/voice/campaigns \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

        "first_name": "Pranta",
        "last_name": "Barua"
      }
    ],

    "agent_outbound_number": "{provisioned_phone}",
    "organization_id": "{org_id}",
    "tenant_id": "{tenant_id}"
  }'
```
