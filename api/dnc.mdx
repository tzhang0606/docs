## What is the DNC List?

The Do Not Call (DNC) list prevents sending messages to contacts who have opted out or requested no contact.

## How DNC Works

### Automatic Blocking

When a contact is on the DNC list:
1. ❌ Campaign messages are **blocked automatically**
2. ❌ Follow-up messages are **blocked automatically**
3. ✅ Manual removal required to re-enable messaging

### STOP Keyword Handling

When a contact replies with "STOP":
1. ✅ Automatically added to DNC list
2. ✅ All future messages blocked
3. ✅ Compliant with regulations

Common STOP keywords:
- STOP, QUIT, UNSUBSCRIBE
- CANCEL, END, REMOVE
- OPTOUT, STOPALL

### DNC Scope

- **Organization-level**: Each organization has its own DNC list
- **Shared across campaigns**: DNC applies to all campaigns in the organization
- **Permanent**: Stays on DNC until manually removed
