## Determining Call Outcomes

Instead of a `disconnection_reason` field, use these fields to determine call outcomes:

| Outcome | How to Detect |
|---------|---------------|
| **Connected** | `connected_calls` count, or check if `call_duration_ms > 0` on individual calls |
| **Voicemail** | `voicemail_calls` count, or check `in_voicemail = true` on individual calls |
| **Failed** | `failed_calls` count - includes no answer, busy, declined |

## Notes

- Analytics are updated in real-time as calls complete
- Sentiment is analyzed automatically from call transcripts
- `not_called` decreases as the campaign progresses
