## Behavior

When a manual SMS is sent:

1. **Message Delivered** - The SMS is sent immediately to the contact
2. **Thread Qualified** - The conversation is marked as "human_takeover"
3. **AI Disabled** - All scheduled AI follow-ups and drip messages are cancelled
4. **Conversation Saved** - The message is added to conversation history
5. **Data Extracted** - Any extraction fields are processed from the full conversation

## Use Cases

- **Live Agent Support** - Customer service representatives responding to inquiries
- **Sales Follow-up** - Sales reps taking over promising leads
- **Complex Issues** - Handling situations AI cannot resolve
- **VIP Customers** - Personal touch for high-value contacts

  "success": false,
  "error": "Missing required fields: campaign_id, phone_number, message"
}
```

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Message text cannot be empty"
