## Notes

<Info>
**Important:** You are responsible for hosting and serving the media files. Store your media in cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure, Cloudinary, etc.) and provide the public URL.
</Info>

- **Media URL must be publicly accessible** - No authentication, API keys, or session cookies
- The media file is fetched directly by the carrier network to deliver to the recipient
- URLs should remain valid for at least 24 hours (carriers may retry failed deliveries)
- Some carriers may have additional size or format restrictions
- Like SMS, sending MMS disables AI follow-ups for the contact
- The contact must already exist in the specified campaign
