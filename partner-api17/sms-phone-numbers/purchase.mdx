## Billing

When a number is purchased:
1. **One-time purchase fee** is charged immediately (if configured)
2. **Weekly recurring fee** starts from purchase date
3. Charges appear in `usage_logs` with appropriate event types

## Notes

- Numbers are purchased from the carrier inventory
- The number is automatically linked to the org's 10DLC campaign
- If `user_id` is provided, the number is assigned immediately
- Numbers without `user_id` go into the org's "available pool"
